# Module: accounts.py

This module implements a simple account management system for a trading simulation platform.

## Class: Account

### Description:
Represents a user account in the trading simulation platform. Allows operations such as deposit, withdrawal, buying and selling shares, and provides various reports on account status, portfolio value, and transaction history.

### Attributes:
- `account_id`: `str` - Unique identifier for the account.
- `balance`: `float` - Current available balance in the account.
- `initial_deposit`: `float` - The total initial deposited amount.
- `holdings`: `dict` - Dictionary to track number of shares held for each symbol. `{'symbol': quantity}`
- `transactions`: `list` - List to track all transactions. Each transaction is represented as a dictionary.

### Methods:

#### `__init__(self, account_id: str)`
Initializes a new account with a given account identifier.

#### `deposit(self, amount: float) -> None`
Deposits a specified amount into the account. Updates the balance and initial deposit.

#### `withdraw(self, amount: float) -> bool`
Withdraws a specified amount from the account if sufficient balance exists. Prevents withdrawal that leads to a negative balance.

#### `buy_shares(self, symbol: str, quantity: int, get_share_price: callable) -> bool`
Buys a specified quantity of shares for a given symbol at the current share price retrieved using `get_share_price(symbol)`. Updates holdings and records the transaction. Prevents purchasing more shares than the account can afford.

#### `sell_shares(self, symbol: str, quantity: int, get_share_price: callable) -> bool`
Sells a specified quantity of shares for a given symbol at the current share price retrieved using `get_share_price(symbol)`. Updates holdings and records the transaction. Prevents selling more shares than are currently held.

#### `get_portfolio_value(self, get_share_price: callable) -> float`
Calculates and returns the total value of the user's portfolio based on current share prices obtained using `get_share_price(symbol)`.

#### `get_profit_or_loss(self, get_share_price: callable) -> float`
Calculates and returns the profit or loss of the user based on the current portfolio value and the initial deposits.

#### `get_holdings(self) -> dict`
Returns a dictionary representing the current holdings of the user.

#### `get_transactions(self) -> list`
Returns a list of all transactions made by the user over time.

---

### Example of Transaction Representation:
Each transaction is represented as a dictionary with the following fields:
- `type`: `str` - 'deposit', 'withdrawal', 'buy', or 'sell'
- `symbol`: `str` - Stock symbol (optional, only for buy/sell)
- `quantity`: `int` - Number of shares (for buy/sell)
- `price`: `float` - Price per share (for buy/sell)
- `amount`: `float` - Total amount for deposit/withdrawal (or `quantity*price` for buy/sell)
- `date`: `datetime` - Timestamp of the transaction

### Usage Example:

```python
from accounts import Account

def get_share_price(symbol):
    fixed_prices = {'AAPL': 150.0, 'TSLA': 750.0, 'GOOGL': 2800.0}
    return fixed_prices.get(symbol, 0.0)

account = Account(account_id="user123")
account.deposit(1000.0)
account.buy_shares('AAPL', 5, get_share_price)
account.sell_shares('AAPL', 2, get_share_price)
account.withdraw(100.0)
portfolio_value = account.get_portfolio_value(get_share_price)
profit_or_loss = account.get_profit_or_loss(get_share_price)
holdings = account.get_holdings()
transactions = account.get_transactions()
```

This design outlines a complete self-contained Python module `accounts.py` with a fully implemented `Account` class, its attributes, and comprehensive methods to manage a trading simulation platform's accounts.
